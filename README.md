## Description

Each dataset is provided as partitioned, zipped JSON files matching the openFDA API schema, ideal for offline analysis or working around API limits. Updated periodicallyâ€”requires re-downloading all partitions to stay current.

## Usage
```{R}
biobricks::install_brick("fda")
biobricks::brick_pull("fda")
biobricks::brick_load("fda")
```
